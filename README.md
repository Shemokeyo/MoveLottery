# Move Lottery

As part of Umojaverse Arbitrum Hackathon, the team (Dennis, Shem and James) worked on the project. This project implements a decentralized lottery system on the Arbitrum blockchain. The smart contract allows users to participate in a lottery by buying tickets, and uses on-chain randomness to select a winner.

## Key Features

1. **Ticket Purchase**: Users can buy lottery tickets.
2. **Random Winner Selection and Payout**: Utilizes Arbitrum' on-chain randomness module for fair winner selection and pays out the prize to the winner in same transaction.
3. **View Functions**: Provides functions to check lottery status, prize amount, and participant count.
